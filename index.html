        <h2 id="intro" class="h2margin">What is Machine Learning?</h2>
        <p>
          Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that
          allows software applications to become more accurate at predicting
          outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine
          learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output
          values.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recommendation engines are a common use case for machine learning.
          Other popular uses include fraud detection, spam filtering, malware
          threat detection, business process automation (BPA) and Predictive
          maintenance.

          What is Machine Learning important?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Machine learning is important because it gives enterprises a view of
          trends in customer behavior and business operational patterns, as well
          as supports the development of new products. Many of today's leading
          companies, such as Facebook, Google and Uber, make machine learning a
          central part of their operations. Machine learning has become a
          significant competitive differentiator for many companies.

        <h2 id="types" class="h2margin">
          What are the different types of Machine Learning?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Classical machine learning is often categorized by how an algorithm
          learns to become more accurate in its predictions. There are four
          basic approaches:supervised learning, unsupervised learning,
          semi-supervised learning and reinforcement learning. The type of
          algorithm data scientists choose to use depends on what type of data
          they want to predict.
        </p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Supervised learning:</strong> In this type of machine
              learning, data scientists supply algorithms with labeled training
              data and define the variables they want the algorithm to assess
              for correlations. Both the input and the output of the algorithm
              is specified.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Unsupervised learning:</strong> This type of machine
              learning involves algorithms that train on unlabeled data. The
              algorithm scans through data sets looking for any meaningful
              connection. The data that algorithms train on as well as the
              predictions or recommendations they output are predetermined.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Semi-supervised learning:</strong> This approach to
              machine learning involves a mix of the two preceding types. Data
              scientists may feed an algorithm mostly labeled training data, but
              the model is free to explore the data on its own and develop its
              own understanding of the data set.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Reinforcement learning:</strong> Data scientists typically
              use reinforcement learning to teach a machine to complete a
              multi-step process for which there are clearly defined rules. Data
              scientists program an algorithm to complete a task and give it
              positive or negative cues as it works out how to complete a task.
              But for the most part, the algorithm decides on its own what steps
              to take along the way.
